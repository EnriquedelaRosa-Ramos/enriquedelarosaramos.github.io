I am a Ph.D. candidate in Development Economics and Economic History at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, with my research centered on the long-term economic disparities within labour markets. Specifically, I explore central aspects such as the gender wage gap, wage premium, and the evolution of real wages, covering the historical continuum from 1870 to the present. Additionally, I investigate specific historical episodes that have significantly influenced contemporary economic outcomes, contributing insights to ongoing debates in economics. An integral aspect of my research involves the digitization of previously undiscovered historical material.

I previously completed my BA at [UDLAP](https://www.udlap.mx/web/){:target="_blank"}- and MSc at [Tulane University](https://tulane.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
